# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection with Machine Learning

This project uses real-world credit card transaction data to detect fraudulent activity using supervised machine learning algorithms. It explores two models: Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier, comparing their performance to accurately identify fraud while minimizing false positives.

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Detect fraudulent credit card transactions
- Compare Logistic Regression and Random Forest models
- Evaluate performance using confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn

## 🔍 Dataset
The dataset used is a publicly available credit card transactions dataset containing 284,807 transactions, of which 492 are frauds.

## 📊 Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
- Accuracy Score

## 📈 Key Findings
- Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression in detecting fraud cases.
- Both models achieved high overall accuracy, but Random Forest had better recall for fraud detection.
